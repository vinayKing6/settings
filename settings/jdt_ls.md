#accident happens if jdt no longer works:
    delete ~/workspace (delete the full folder)
#in order to make a project so that all files can be searched by  jdt ,then have to use maven:
    for example:
        algorithm/:
            |src/
                |main/
                    |java/
                        |algorithm
                |test/
            |target/
            |pom.xml
